# Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

 **IBM Watson Studio AutoAI** to classify infrastructure projects into PMGSY schemes.

---

## Problem Statement

Develop a machine learning model to automatically classify rural road/bridge construction projects into one of the following PMGSY schemes:
- PMGSY-I
- PMGSY-II
- RCPLWEA
- etc.

Classification is based on physical and financial characteristics such as project length, cost, number of works completed, and expenditure.
